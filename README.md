[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nike-Inc/gimme-aws-creds.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nike-Inc/gimme-aws-creds)

gimme-aws-creds is a CLI that utilizes an [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) IdP via SAML to acquire temporary AWS credentials via AWS STS.

Okta is a SAML identity provider (IdP), that can be easily set-up to do SSO to your AWS console. Okta does offer an [OSS java CLI]((https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role)) tool to obtain temporary AWS credentials, but I found it needs more information than the average Okta user would have and doesn't scale well if have more than one Okta App.

With gimme-aws-creds all you need to know is your username, password, Okta url and MFA token, if MFA is enabled. gimme-aws-creds gives you the option to select which Okta AWS application and role you want credentials for. Alternatively, you can pre-configure the app and role name by passing -c or editing the config file. This is all covered in the usage section.

## Prerequisites

[Okta SAML integration to AWS using the AWS App](https://support.okta.com/help/servlet/fileField?retURL=%2Fhelp%2Farticles%2FKnowledge_Article%2FAmazon-Web-Services-and-Okta-Integration-Guide&entityId=ka0F0000000MeyyIAC&field=File_Attachment__Body__s)

Python 3

### Optional
[Gimme-creds-lambda](https://github.com/Nike-Inc/gimme-aws-creds/tree/master/lambda) can be used as a proxy to the Okta APIs needed by gimme-aws-creds.  This removes the requirement of an Okta API key.  Gimme-aws-creds authenticates to gimme-creds-lambda using OpenID Connect and the lambda handles all interactions with the Okta APIs.  Alternately, you can set the `OKTA_API_KEY` environment variable and the `gimme_creds_server` configuration value to 'internal' to call the Okta APIs directly from gimme-aws-creds.


## Installation
This is a Python 3 project.

Install/Upgrade from PyPi:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade gimme-aws-creds
```

__OR__

Install/Upgrade the latest gimme-aws-creds package direct from GitHub:
```bash
pip3 install --upgrade git+git://github.com/Nike-Inc/gimme-aws-creds.git
```

__OR__

Install the gimme-aws-creds package if you have already cloned the source:
```bash
python3 setup.py install
```

## Configuration

To set-up the configuration run:
```bash
gimme-aws-creds --configure
```

You can also set up different Okta configuration profiles, this useful if you have multiple Okta accounts or environments you need credentials for. You can use the configuration wizard or run:
```bash
gimme-aws-creds --configure --profile profileName
```

A configuration wizard will prompt you to enter the necessary configuration parameters for the tool to run, the only one that is required is the `okta_org_url`. The configuration file is written to `~/.okta_aws_login_config`.

- conf_profile - This sets the Okta configuration profile name, the default is DEFAULT.
- okta_org_url - This is your Okta organization url, which is typically something like `https://companyname.okta.com`.
- okta_auth_server - [Okta API Authorization Server](https://help.okta.com/en/prev/Content/Topics/Security/API_Access.htm) used for OpenID Connect authentication for gimme-creds-lambda
- client_id - OAuth client ID for gimme-creds-lambda
- gimme_creds_server
	- URL for gimme-creds-lambda
	- 'internal' for direct interaction with the Okta APIs (`OKTA_API_KEY` environment variable required)
	- 'appurl' to set an aws application link url. This setting removes the need of an OKTA API key.
- write_aws_creds - True or False - If True, the AWS credentials will be written to `~/.aws/credentials` otherwise it will be written to stdout.
- cred_profile - If writing to the AWS cred file, this sets the name of the AWS credential profile.  The reserved word 'role' will use the name component of the role arn as the profile name.  i.e. arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/okta-1234-role becomes section [okta-1234-role] in the aws credentials file
- aws_appname - This is optional. The Okta AWS App name, which has the role you want to assume.
- aws_rolename - This is optional. The ARN of the role you want temporary AWS credentials for.  The reserved word 'all' can be used to get and store credentials for every role the user is permissioned for.
- aws_default_duration = This is optional. Lifetime for temporary credentials, in seconds. Defaults to 1 hour (3600)
- app_url - If using 'appurl' setting for gimme_creds_server, this sets the url to the aws application configured in Okta. It is typically something like https://something.okta[preview].com/home/amazon_aws/app_instance_id/something
- okta_username - use this username to authenticate
- preferred_mfa_type - automatically select a particular  device when prompted for MFA:
  - push - Okta Verify App push
  - token:software:totp - OTP using the Okta Verify App
  - call - OTP via Voice call
  - sms - OTP via SMS message
- resolve_aws_alias - y or n. If yes, gimme-aws-creds will try to resolve AWS account ids with respective alias names (default: n). This option can also be set interactively in the command line using `-r` or `--resolve parameter`

## Usage

**If you are not using gimme-creds-lambda nor using appurl settings, make sure you set the OKTA_API_KEY environment variable.**

After running --configure, just run gimme-aws-creds. You will be prompted for the necessary information.

```bash
$ ./gimme-aws-creds
Username: user@domain.com
Password for user@domain.com:
Authentication Success! Calling Gimme-Creds Server...
Pick an app:
[ 0 ] AWS Test Account
[ 1 ] AWS Prod Account
Selection: 1
Pick a role:
[ 0 ]: OktaAWSAdminRole
[ 1 ]: OktaAWSReadOnlyRole
Selection: 1
Multi-factor Authentication required.
Pick a factor:
[ 0 ] Okta Verify App: SmartPhone_IPhone: iPhone
[ 1 ] token:software:totp: user@domain.com
Selection: 0
Okta Verify push sent...
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AQWERTYUIOP
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=T!#$JFLOJlsoddop1029405-P
```

You can run a specific configuration profile with the `--profile` parameter:

```bash
$ ./gimme-aws-creds --profile profileName
```

The username and password you are prompted for are the ones you login to Okta with. You can predefine your username by setting the `OKTA_USERNAME` environment variable or using the `-u username` parameter.

If you have not configured an Okta App or Role, you will prompted to select one.

If all goes well you will get your temporary AWS access, secret key and token, these will either be written to stdout or `~/.aws/credentials`.

You can always run `gimme-aws-creds --help` for all the available options.

## Running Tests

You can run all the unit tests using nosetests. Most of the tests are mocked.

```bash
$ nosetests --verbosity=2 tests/
```

## Thanks and Credit
I came across [okta_aws_login](https://github.com/nimbusscale/okta_aws_login) written by Joe Keegan, when I was searching for a CLI tool that generates AWS tokens via Okta. Unfortunately it hasn't been updated since 2015 and didn't seem to work with the current Okta version. But there was still some great code I was able to reuse under the MIT license for gimme-aws-creds. I have noted in the comments where I used his code, to make sure he receives proper credit.
